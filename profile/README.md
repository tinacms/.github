Tina is the world's leading open source, headless CMS that is powered by **Markdown** and GitHub.
It also supports MDX, JSON, Yaml, and more. 

It comes with a GraphQL API:
- Query your Markdown content like this ðŸ‘‰ `post.author.firstName`
- Supports statically generated and server side rendered pages
- Supports references between documents

Tina offers a live preview (optional and opt-in) that makes editing Markdown files very intuitive for less-technical people.
